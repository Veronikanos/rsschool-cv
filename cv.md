### Summary:
I am in the beginning of my career. I spent some years doing different stuff and searching for my passion. 
I spend almost all of my time studying. I tried several directions in tech and non-tech to decide what kind of job I would like to dive into. Since I made my first web api and I decided that frontend development is what I want to do. I decided to pursue my career in web-development and to get my first job as a junior frontend developer as soon as possible because I feel it is my place.

      return pontoonDistance / youSpeed <= sharkTime ? "Alive!" : "Shark Bait!";
    }
